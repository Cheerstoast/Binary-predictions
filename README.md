# Binary predictor
#### Written in python 3 by Mark Z

## 1. What it does

This is a program that is able to do binary classification.
In other words, it would be able to give you a "Yes" or "No" answer, if you give it some inputs.
This would be a good first AI to run.

## 2. Building
To get it running on your machine, you would need python3 and numpy and tensorflow modules installed.

    pip3 install numpy tensorflow
    
Afer that, build the program. First get the ZIP from github, unzip it, and then delete the zip file. 


    curl -s -LO https://github.com/Cheerstoast/Binary-predictions/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -o main.zip && unzip main.zip && rm main.zip

## 3. Usage

    
To run the program, navigate to the "Binary-predictions-main" folder, wherever it is

    cd Binary-predictions-main

and then just run

    python3 main.py

Takes a while to start.
Anyway, it would be exciting to run your first AI.

### Enjoy >!<
